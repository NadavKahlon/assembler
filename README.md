# assembler-20465
An assembler program - my final project in a System Programming course I took in Spring 2020 at The Open University of Israel.

To use it, compile it using ```make``` and run: `assembler/assembler [program_path]` where ```program_path``` is a path to your assembly program (```.as``` file), without the extension.\
For more detail, please view the attached project specifications file.

Some examples can be found in ```examples```.
