# assembler-20465
An assembler program - my final project in a System Programming course I took in Spring 2020 in The Open University of Israel.

To use it, run:
> assembler/assembler [program_path]

where 'program_path' is a path to your assembler program (.as file), without the extension.

Some examples can be found in assembler/examples.
